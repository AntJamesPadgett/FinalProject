<time> Year is 2000, roughly January.</time> The Year is 2000. Just left active duty in the Army. I served in Fort Riley Kansas, my first real experience living outside New York City, where i was born and raised. My wife also served, so I had a six month wait to leave Fort Riley Ks.. in that time, I drove city buses after getting a CDL. A buddy whose wife also served in the Army hooked me up!!

         <time> Year is 2001</time> Arrive in Alabama, after a coin - toss between the wife and I to see if we would end up in NYC or Alabama. My Mother stated she knew once I left NYC and experienced other parts of the country, I wouldnt return to NYC, She was right..Hence why this is called Anthony Padgett 2.0!

            <time> Also 2001</time> After my first two weeks in Alabama get a temp job with Man Power.. they send me to Transport Refrigeration. The interview is very interesting and speaks volumes to how far i have come from not knowing what a 9/16 wrench was to now. Im hired permanently after six months.. a year or so after that , they send me to Carrier Refrigeration Tech school,Im certified to start working on refrigerated, Trailers, Trains and Containers. I enjoy the thrill of trouble-shooting, issues and im promoted to lead Man in the shop, im also the youngest by about ten to fifteen years, so you can imagine that doesnt go over to well with the more tenured employees, but I make it happen and do the job to the best of my ability. BUt also being so young and inexperienced, I didnt realize the promotion
             should come with a raise....

           <time> 2003</time> I see an article in the News paper, YES NEWS PAPER about the Mercedes Benz Plant expanding and hiring... FUN FACT.. I applied for MBUSI before i became a resident of Alabama, i was informed I had to live here two years before applying.. meaning a dream deferred is not a dream denied! I apply and literally wait a year to hear anything back. Once I hear something back, I have six weeks of testing to get hired on.. I do the testing after I get off my regular job of course.

        <time>2004</time> Turn in my two week notice with Transport Refigeration and thank them for giving me a chance and training me with a skill that will last a lifetime... My General Manager states hes happy and proud of the moves I have made and realized one day I would outgrow the position.. His boss doesnt speak to me the duration of the time I have left, guess he told it personal... when it was only business..hahaha

    <time>2005</time> Hired on full time with MBUSI. Im on Trim 3. First Team Leader is Eddie Hughes, hes been in the plant eight years at that point. He takes me under his wing and has me learning everything I possibly can. I learn station after station until I learn my entire zone. Little Does Eddie know.. I model my future leadership abilities after him.. EXCELLENT leadership. I move from zone to zone.. eventually learning the entire line.. roughly thirty plus stations.. once I get locked into something.. I try to excel in it!!

          <time>2012</time> I get a new supervisor and also get promoted..Talk about timing. I studied all of the Team Leaders on my line and took all the attributes I liked that they had and molded myself into what I thought was a great Team Leader. I did the samething I did as a team member, I was over zone three.. I learned my entire zone.. i wss one of a few Team Leaders that actually knew their entire zone.. from there I started learning every zone to the left and right until I learned the entire line again.. I could now cover another zone when someone was out as well as help out repairing things. The enteresting thing about my drive was that my counterparts didnt like it too much and I noticed it.. Kept doing what i was supposed to do.

      <time>2017</time> Signed up for a Flex team leader job. I felt it was time to see something else outside of Trim three and truth be told, I never feared change.. thats literally what my life had been since leaving New York. Some how even Though senority played apart, I got the Flex Team Leader job in the new expanded part of the plant. I was gonna be the A shift Flex Team Leader over the new Cockpit/Console area. In that area I had seven team members under me that helped teach a contracting company how to build cockpits and consoles. The contracting company consisted of roughly fifty plus and each of my team member had a zone of contractors they helped mold. I got to start supervising and seeing things from different angles.. I had to help motivate a company of employees that I couldnt discipline, so I had to be resourceful in my approach to get them to see the big picture while still supporting my team.

        <time>2020</time> Anthony Padgett 3.0 is just around the corner! a few life changing events have happened within the last two years or so and turned my world upside down. I need a reset. I have always loved computers.. Tony Avieratter and myself  even built a few computers back in the day. I enroll in a Software Engineering boot camp and test the waters.. this is where my journey truly begins...strap on your seatbelts.
